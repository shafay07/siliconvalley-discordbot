***I have developed this bot for all the Silicon Valley fans to enjoy these fun quotes in their discord chats. Feel free to add more functionalities by making a pull request.***

Repo includes:
- Python scraper, that generates json quotes for each actor
- Node.js discord bot which makes use of json files to randomly pick a quote
